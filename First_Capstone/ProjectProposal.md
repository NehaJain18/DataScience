## [Otto Group Product Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge)

**Background and Client**  
The client here is the Otto Group. It is one of the largest e-commerce companies with subsidiaries in 20+ countries. With such a global reach, each day millions of products are sold. A consistent analysis of their products is crucial. Because of their diverse infrastructure there have been one major challenge that I am going to discuss next.

**Problem**  
Identical products are getting classified as different in their current system. And this brings up challenges in analysis of different product ranges. Ideally each product should belong to one and only one of the major product categories. And also that should be the best matching category for that product. The better the classification more insights could be generated about their product range.

**Data**
The data has been provided by the client. But it is not into the raw form. For 200,000 products, 93 features are provided. The meaning or actual name of the features is hidden and only the numerical values are given. The idea is to learn from these features for the existing products and the categories they belong and be able to classify new products into the given categories.

**Solution Approach**
  - Understand the given data thoroughly. What type of files and data are given. What format the final solution should be.
  - Data cleaning. Resolve missing values. Transfrom data into required format if needed.
  - Exploratory data analysis. Visualize the data in different forms to get insights into.
  - Feature engineering. Data modeling. Derive new features if needed. Normalize feature if needed.
  - Try to fit different Classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVMs or Neural networks. Learn how these algorithms compare. Find the best model and use it for final predictions. While fitting the models keep in mind the cross validation methods to find best hyper parameters for the chosen algorithm.
  - Make a report mentioning the details about the chosen model and how to apply it to predict product categories for new products.
    
**Deliverables**
  - Differnt .ipynb files for Data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, Model fitting etc.
  - Final report summarizing the problem and solution. Instructions to run the code to do the predictions for the new product's categories.
