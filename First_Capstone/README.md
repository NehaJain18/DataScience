## [Otto Group Product Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge)

The current directory is going to have all the work and code related to the first capstone project "Otto Group Product Classification". This problem was chosen after exploring few ideas. The other ideas were complex and didn't have sufficient data at hand.

The [project proposal](https://github.com/NehaJain18/DataScience/blob/master/First_Capstone/ProjectProposal.md) talk in detail about the problem at hand and the approach I am going to follow. This problem is from a Kaggle challenge. The aim is to go through the whole DataScience process and apply all the knowledge earned so far.
