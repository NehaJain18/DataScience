    "## Theory and Approach followed\n",
    "Our goal is to develop a model that describes the relationship between the features in the data and the target class (product category). So far we have got good understanding of the data and we can apply the machine learning algorithms and find out the best model. Technically speaking, this is Supervised Classification ML problem. Here we have the training data with the actual labels. We need to model that and use the model to predict labels for new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with a quick and dirty baseline model. And improve upon our model in interative fashion. Following are some ideas to keep in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='section2'></a>\n",
    "### Overfitting and Underfitting\n",
    "When the model fits the training data too perfectly but not the test data, it is called overfitting. Such a model will not be useful for predictions. While at the other extreme end our model might fit the training data very poorly. Consequently, it can't fit test data any better and will give inaccurate predictions. Generally its a trade off between overfitting and underfitting. This is also called **Bias-Variance trade-off**. When the model fits too well to the training data (a subset of population) it has low Bias, that is, it mimics the data very well. But it might fail miserably in mimicking the test data (another subset of population). Or it has variance between different subsets of data. As we try to make this variance low, it will increase the Bias.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In our case, the number of data points is very large (67 thousand) as compared to the number of features. This will help in avoiding overfitting. We are going to always compare train and test accuracy to see how well the model fits. We should also design train-test split of the data wisely to regulate the bias-variance trade off.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<a id='section3'></a>    \n",
    "### Model Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "Evaluating our model closely relates with how the model is going to be used by the client. In case of classification problems one type of error (say false negative) might be more costly then another type of error (false positive). In such a case our model should be more stringent for false negatives.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In our case we need to classify each product (described by 93 features) into correct class. As such both type of errors have equal weightage. One important fact is that our traning data has class imbalance. There is more data for some classes then others. This is important consideration while chosing the model evaluation criterion. We should try and handle the class imbalance problem and see if improve our models. Criteria that we are going to use.\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Although important we can't rely on just that. Because we have class imabalnce, our accuracy might be high but predictions for minority class might be wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Confusion Matirx**: This would tell us how many precdictions we got wrong for each class. And how well the minority classes are doing along with majority classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classification Matrix**: To measure precision, recall and F1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) for each class. It tells us average F1 score for all classes too. This can serve as a single value to compare the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Log loss**: This is the evaluation criteria used by the client (Otto Group). So this is our main criterion to compare and improve the models. Each product has been labeled with one true category. For each product, we find a set of predicted probabilities (one for every category). The formula is then,\n",
    "  \\begin{equation*}\n",
    "        logloss=-\\dfrac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^M \\sum_{i=1}^N y_{ij}log(p_{ij}),\n",
    "  \\end{equation*}\n",
    "    where N is the number of products in the test set, M is the number of class labels, log is the natural logarithm, yij is 1 if observation i is in class j and 0 otherwise, and pij is the predicted probability that observation i belongs to class j."
