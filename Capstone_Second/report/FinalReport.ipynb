    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of any business is to make profits for its owners and stakeholders. Also, the 80/20 rule has proven true for many businesses–only a small percentage of customers produce most of the revenue. \n",
    "\n",
    "For an e-store like Google merchandise store, it is nothing different. As such, marketing teams are challenged to make appropriate investments in promotional strategies. But for that, they need as accurate a prediction as possible, of the revenue per customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although, the main prediction is not for future, i.e. we predict revenues for the visits already done. But there might be a second phase of the project where we predict for future dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='section2'></a>\n",
    "# Client\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the client is the company Google and its specific e-store called Google Merchandise Store (GStore). We hope to provide highly accurate revenue predictions per customer visiting the GStore. The outcome should be more actionable operational changes and a better use of marketing budgets. Also, it would be serve as an evidence for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data, because the current data comes from the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='section3'></a>\n",
    "# Data and its acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is provided by the client in the form of csv file. There is some additional test data that can be used to evaluate and report the algorithm success. The main data file has around 900 thousand rows corresponding to each cusomter visit to the GStore. There are multiple columns which contain JSON blobs of varying depth. In one of those JSON columns, totals, the sub-column transactionRevenue contains the revenue information we are trying to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading the data will not be very simple because the json blobs need to be parsed. I am using the read_csv function provided by the python-pandas library to load the data into datafrme. Json converters are used to parse the Json fields. The result is a table like structure that can be used for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the Data Fields:\n",
    "- <b>fullVisitorId</b> - A unique identifier for each user of the Google Merchandise Store.\n",
    "- <b>channelGrouping</b> - The channel via which the user came to the Store.\n",
    "- <b>date</b> - The date on which the user visited the Store.\n",
    "- <b>device</b> - The specifications for the device used to access the Store.\n",
    "- <b>geoNetwork</b> - This section contains information about the geography of the user.\n",
    "- <b>sessionId</b> - A unique identifier for this visit to the store.\n",
    "- <b>socialEngagementType</b> - Engagement type, either \"Socially Engaged\" or \"Not Socially Engaged\".\n",
    "- <b>totals</b> - This section contains aggregate values across the session.\n",
    "- <b>trafficSource</b> - This section contains information about the Traffic Source from which the session originated.\n",
    "- <b>visitId</b> - An identifier for this session. This is part of the value usually stored as the _utmb_ cookie. This is only unique to the user. For a completely unique ID, you should use a combination of fullVisitorId and visitId.\n",
    "- <b>visitNumber</b> - The session number for this user. If this is the first session, then this is set to 1.\n",
    "- <b>visitStartTime</b> - The timestamp (expressed as POSIX time).\n",
    "- <b>hits</b> - This row and nested fields are populated for any and all types of hits. Provides a record of all page visits.\n",
    "- <b>customDimensions</b> - This section contains any user-level or session-level custom dimensions that are set for a session. This is a repeated field and has an entry for each dimension that is set.\n",
    "- <b>totals</b> - This set of columns mostly includes high-level aggregate data.\n"

    "## Theory and Approach followed\n",
    "Our goal is to develop a model that describes the relationship between the features in the data and the target class (product category). So far we have got good understanding of the data and we can apply the machine learning algorithms and find out the best model. Technically speaking, this is Supervised Regression ML problem. Here we have the training data with the actual labels. We need to model that and use the model to predict labels for new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with a quick and dirty baseline model. And improve upon our model in interative fashion. Following are some ideas to keep in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='section22'></a>\n",
    "### Overfitting and Underfitting\n",
    "When the model fits the training data too perfectly but not the test data, it is called overfitting. Such a model will not be useful for predictions. While at the other extreme end our model might fit the training data very poorly. Consequently, it can't fit test data any better and will give inaccurate predictions. Generally its a trade off between overfitting and underfitting. This is also called **Bias-Variance trade-off**. When the model fits too well to the training data (a subset of population) it has low Bias, that is, it mimics the data very well. But it might fail miserably in mimicking the test data (another subset of population). Or it has variance between different subsets of data. As we try to make this variance low, it will increase the Bias.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In our case, the number of data points is very large (900 thousand) as compared to the number of features. This will help in avoiding overfitting. We are going to always compare train and test accuracy to see how well the model fits. We should also design train-test split of the data wisely to regulate the bias-variance trade off.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<a id='section23'></a>    \n",
    "### Model Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "Evaluating our model closely relates with how the model is going to be used by the client. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: This is the evaluation criteria used by the client (Google). So this is our main criterion to compare and improve the models. It is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/rmse-formula.png\" width=\"400\" align=\"center\"> \n",
    "where y hat is the natural log of the predicted revenue for a customer and y is the natural log of the actual summed revenue value plus one.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='section24'></a>    \n",
    "### Data and code organization\n",
    "- <b>Data files generated and saved instead of data pipelines in the runtime</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Although data pipelines are generally used to transform train and test data sets. In this project the data is huge and we don't want to run all the steps of datapipeline while development. Moreover there is not much of data transformation. Mainly we do the Standard Scaling and save the resulting data as a file in the /data folder. This file is used for training of most the models. Similiarly the cleaned data files are also saved into the /data folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Python functions written to apply the DRY principle</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Since lot of things are repetitive like fitting the data, evaluating the results etc. we have written Python functions that are used multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='section25'></a>    \n",
    "### Data preparation before modeling\n",
    "- <b>Cardinality reduction</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "    The data has a large number of categorical variables and the cardinality of those variables is high. That is the number of unique values for some of the categories is huge. For e.g. network domain has 27996 unique values. Ultimately categorical variable get one hot encoded with one columns for each unique value. And this will drastically increase the size of data for modeling.\n",
    "    Because of resource(memory and compute) constraints, we start with merging the less frequent values into a grouped dummy value. Specifically, all the values ocurring less than 1% time for a particular category are grouped into a single value dummy_column_name. Some examples:\n",

    "- **quarter** - The whole year can be divided into quarters. This feature might capture holiday season or financial year start etc.\n",
    "- **week_day_end** - As seen from EDA there are more logins or weekends but less sales. It might indicate that people have leisure time and they browse and not necessarily interested in buying.\n",
    "- **holidays** - At the end of the year there is first rise in the number of the logins and then some days later there is rise in revenue transactions. We can define that period as holiday period.\n",
    "- **month_period** - Whole month can be divided into start, mid and end. Start might indicate the arrival of salaries etc. Month end might be related to more expenditure.\n",
    "- **active_hours** - As seen during the EDA that morning hours are generally low on revenue transactions. This makes sense because people are generally busy getting ready for the work day ahead.\n",

We intend to carry that out as the second phase of the project. It will involve Time Series modeling and the model will be based on per visitor. The goal can be summarized as: Predict for the current visitors, if they will generate any revenue for future month (or some period) and if yes predict the amount too.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current problem was hard because of the huge amount of data (1 million rows approx.). Due to the lack of available resources we could not try out XGB or NeuralNets on the full data (full cardinality categorical features) and with cross validation. Given more resources we can try those models.\n",

    "We can try many more new features like:\n",
    "- Cross features like device_browser, browser_networkDomain, hits_to_pageviews_ratio\n",
    "- We can try assigning ranks to unique values of categorical variables. The ranks can be based on mean revenue for that value of category or count of visits. For e.g. the \"Northen America\" region has the highest mean revenue. And so it can be given rank 1st and so on."
